ENHANCING DATA INTEGRITY WITH MACHINE-LEARNING BASED QUALITY CONTROL SYSTEMS
This study presents a hybrid machine-learning-based quality control (QC) framework designed to significantly enhance the integrity of high-frequency meteorological data collected from Automatic Weather Stations in Rwanda. The framework integrates rule-based checks, statistical analyses, and unsupervised machine learning models to detect and correct errors in temperature, humidity, rainfall, wind speed, and wind direction. Rule-based and statistical layers efficiently identify gross and subtle anomalies, while ML models capture complex temporal, spatial, and inter-variable patterns, preserving extreme events essential for climate monitoring, flood early warning, and extreme weather analysis. The system leverages additional features temporal variables, lagged values, rolling statistics, and inter-variable consistency indicators to further enhance anomaly detection. Performance evaluation using precision, recall, and F1-score demonstrates robust classification for temperature and humidity, with improved detection of rainfall and wind anomalies when multivariate features are included. Scalable, adaptive, and reliable, this hybrid QC framework provides high-quality datasets that strengthen forecasting, climate analysis, and operational decision-making in Rwanda’s meteorological services.
